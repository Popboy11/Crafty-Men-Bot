# Crafty-Men-Bot
 JS Discord bot made for getting the status of my Minecraft server, slap on DiscordSRV and you're good to go.

 If you're running spigot or something similar, it will get "Spigot 1.16.1", so I just have the version and some other things as strings because it looks better, more condensed on the bot status. Also a fun quirk is that DiscordSRV forces the bot online whenever it's on, so the bot being away at 0 players on won't work, but going DND when the server is down works because DiscordSRV isn't on to mess with that.
